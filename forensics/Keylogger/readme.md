I wanted to see what my sister does on my PC when I'm gone but didn't want to download any dodgy keylogging software, so I used Wireshark instead. Unfortunately, I have no idea which USB device is the keyboard, and definitely don't know how to read these packets. Maybe the USB Implementers Forum has some documentation on these sorts of Human Interface Devices. 

*Note: please do not start capturing packets on this network, make sure you're only opening the attached 'keylogger.pcap'.* 


Free Hint: I wonder if anyone else has tried making a CTF challenge about this sort of stuff before? Maybe some looking through writeups would come in handy.
