### Description
On a trip to Belgium I went to this cool place with a monastery and an old flag with ducks on it. Unfortunately, someone graffitied my photo with eu flags, logos and other stuff! can you find the place that has this flag and building??

Flag format: quack{townname}


### Solution
This challenge has multiple solutions.

1. Use reverse image searching to find similar images of flags or monasteries. The image has purposely been edited to make this harder though.

2. Look up monasteries/abbeys with clocktowers in belgium and try and find the specific place.

3. Try and reconstruct the flag with photo editing etc to then use reverse image searching. 

4. Use a flag identifying site to try and narrow down where the flag is from. e.g https://flagid.org/
