### Description
I received this document from my friend which promised cute cat pictures. But as it turns out, my friend had been hacked yesterday and the document was actually a virus! Good thing my antivirus caught it before I opened it.

I have attached a disk image of my computer, can you use your forensics skills to find out who hacked my friend?
