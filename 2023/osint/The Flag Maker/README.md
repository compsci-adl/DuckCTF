## The Flag Maker

I found this cool instagram account that makes flags.
Could you see if you can get them to make me one?
Try using your detective skills like that sherlock guy.

# Solution

Visit the duckflags instagram account and find the post that mentions sending an email to the account owner.

Use the python program sherlock or different username enumeration techniques to find accounts on other websites with the same username as the instagram account.

Visit the duckflags092 account at <https://last.fm/user/duckflags092>, <https://lichess.org/@/duckflags092> and <https://duckflags092.blogspot.com>.

Each of these sites will contain a piece of the email which will produce the email <theduckflagmaker842@gmail.com> when combined. There will also be other accounts that do not contain any pieces.

Send an email to this account in order to recieve a reply containing the flag.
